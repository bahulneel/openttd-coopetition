comment: |
  Scenario goals are shared objectives that all players work together to achieve.
  This example shows network length tracking with complex constraints.

objective:
  type: network_length
  amount: 500
  track_type: "rail"
  comment: "Build 500 tiles of rail network"

constraints:
  players:
    min: 3
    max: 6
  date:
    min: 1960
    max: 1980
  map_size:
    min: 256
    max: 512
  comment: "3-6 players, 1960-1980 timeframe, medium to large maps"

shared:
  track: true
  stations: true
  vehicles: true
  depots: true
