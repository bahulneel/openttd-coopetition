| TDR-001 | Naming taxonomy | `MoleculeDashboardCard` reads poorly when reversed ("Card Dashboard Molecule"). | Inconsistent plain-English readability; weak taxonomy signal.                                                                 | ✅ RESOLVED: Renamed to `MoleculeCardDashboard` for better reverse readability ("Dashboard Card Molecule"). | –     | 2025-09-06 | ~~Medium~~ |

No changes needed.                                                                     | –     | 2025-09-06 | ~~Low~~ |

| TDR-004 | GameScript API  | Station ownership checking not available in OpenTTD GS API                     | Station counting goals are simplified and may not be accurate for individual companies.                                       | Document API limitation and consider alternative approaches (e.g., station proximity to company infrastructure).                         | –     | 2025-01-27 | Medium   |
| TDR-005 | GameScript API  | Town service tracking simplified due to API limitations                        | Town service goals are placeholder implementations and may not reflect actual service.                                         | Document API limitation and consider alternative tracking methods or remove feature until API improves.                                  | –     | 2025-01-27 | Medium   |
| TDR-006 | GameScript API  | Route efficiency tracking not implemented                                      | Route efficiency goals are placeholders and don't provide actual functionality.                                               | Implement basic route efficiency calculation or remove feature until proper implementation is feasible.                                  | –     | 2025-01-27 | Low      |
| TDR-007 | Component Architecture | Missing Domain/Objective/Default/Display/Summary component                    | Goal cards reference non-existent component for objective display.                                                            | ✅ RESOLVED: Component exists and is working correctly.                               | –     | 2025-01-27 | ~~High~~ |
| TDR-008 | Component Architecture | Missing Domain/RewardSet/Display/Summary component                            | Goal cards reference non-existent component for reward display.                                                               | ✅ RESOLVED: Component exists and is working correctly.                                       | –     | 2025-01-27 | ~~High~~ |
| TDR-009 | Component Architecture | Atomic design implementation incomplete                                        | Some Template and Molecule components were missing, reducing consistency in component usage.                                   | ✅ RESOLVED: Created missing Template/Layout/List and Molecule/Form/Collection components. Updated Aggregate components to use proper layouts. | –     | 2025-01-27 | Medium   |

Notes:

- See taxonomy guidance in `docs/components/decomposition.md` (Path & Naming Taxonomy). Favor paths as a readable taxonomy; ensure reverse readability; avoid redundancy because Nuxt concatenates path parts into FQNs.
- When resolving these items, update the catalog and the decomposition guide to reflect the rule, then apply across the tree in a dedicated naming pass.
