| TDR-001 | Naming taxonomy | `MoleculeDashboardCard` reads poorly when reversed ("Card Dashboard Molecule"). | Inconsistent plain-English readability; weak taxonomy signal.                                                                 | Prefer path `Molecule/Dashboard/Card` (already in use). Consider FQN adjustment to `MoleculeCardDashboard` if we standardize "component-kind-last" in FQNs. Cross-check against catalog before change. | –     | 2025-09-06 | Medium   |

If we later standardize FQNs to "ComponentKindLast", consider `MoleculeLinkAction` for symmetry.                                                                     | –     | 2025-09-06 | Low      |

Only rename if we adopt global FQN renaming rules.                                                                                                                 | –     | 2025-09-06 | Low      |
| TDR-004 | GameScript API  | Station ownership checking not available in OpenTTD GS API                     | Station counting goals are simplified and may not be accurate for individual companies.                                       | Document API limitation and consider alternative approaches (e.g., station proximity to company infrastructure).                         | –     | 2025-01-27 | Medium   |
| TDR-005 | GameScript API  | Town service tracking simplified due to API limitations                        | Town service goals are placeholder implementations and may not reflect actual service.                                         | Document API limitation and consider alternative tracking methods or remove feature until API improves.                                  | –     | 2025-01-27 | Medium   |

Notes:

- See taxonomy guidance in `docs/components/decomposition.md` (Path & Naming Taxonomy). Favor paths as a readable taxonomy; ensure reverse readability; avoid redundancy because Nuxt concatenates path parts into FQNs.
- When resolving these items, update the catalog and the decomposition guide to reflect the rule, then apply across the tree in a dedicated naming pass.
