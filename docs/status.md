## ðŸš§ Todo

### GameScript Mod
- **Goal Progress Tracking**: UpdateProgress() methods not fully implemented
  - Event listeners for cargo delivery, station building, vehicle creation
  - Progress calculation and storage
  - Goal completion detection and rewards
- **UI Rendering**: Dashboard UI rendering methods incomplete
  - StoryBook page creation and updates
  - Goals window entries with progress bars
  - News messages for milestones and completion
- **Event Handling**: Game event listeners for goal progress
  - Cargo delivery event handling
  - Station construction event handling
  - Vehicle creation/removal event handling
- **Settings Integration**: Connect settings to actual functionality
  - UI visibility toggles working
  - Reminder system implementation
  - Reward system integration

### Campaign Editor
- **Goal/Scenario UI Pages**: Store exists but is NOT being used - pages show "Coming Soon"
  - Store has full CRUD operations for goals/scenarios but UI doesn't use them
  - Replace "Coming Soon" pages with actual goal editor using existing store
  - Replace "Coming Soon" pages with actual scenario editor using existing store
  - Connect existing store methods to UI forms
  - Add proper form validation and error handling
- **Advanced Validation**: Business rule validation beyond schema
  - Cross-field validation (min/max players, date ranges)
  - Goal reference validation
  - Circular dependency detection
- **Preview System**: Real-time preview of campaign changes
  - Live preview of goal descriptions
  - Constraint validation feedback
  - Campaign flow visualization

### Testing & Integration
- **End-to-End Testing**: Test full workflow from editor to game
  - Create campaign in editor
  - Export and import in OpenTTD
  - Goal progress tracking in game
  - UI updates in game
- **Goal Progress**: Test goal tracking in actual OpenTTD
  - Cargo delivery tracking
  - Station building tracking
  - Vehicle count tracking
- **Multiplayer Testing**: Test in multiplayer scenarios
  - Shared goal progress across companies
  - Personal goal isolation
  - UI updates for all players

## ðŸ’­ Future Considerations
