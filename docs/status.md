# Project Status

## âœ… Done

### GameScript Mod (`src/`)

- **Core Classes**: PlayerGoal, SharedGoal, Campaign, Dashboard classes implemented
- **Basic Structure**: Main controller with settings and state management
- **API Integration**: OpenTTD GS API v14+ registration and settings
- **UI Framework**: Dashboard class for UI management
- **Goal Types**: Cargo delivery, town population, station rating, network length, vehicle count

### Campaign Content (`campaigns/`)

- **YAML Files**: Sample campaigns, goals, and scenarios in YAML format
- **Build System**: `compile-authoring.mjs` tool for YAML â†’ Squirrel compilation
- **Validation**: Schema validation in compilation tool

### Build Tools (`tools/`)

- **Compilation**: `compile-authoring.mjs` - YAML to Squirrel compiler
- **API Verification**: `verify-gs-api.mjs` - OpenTTD GS API usage validation
- **ESLint Plugin**: `eslint-plugin-openttd-gs` - Custom GameScript linting
- **Documentation Cache**: `gs-doc-cache.mjs` - API documentation caching

### Campaign Editor (`workspaces/campaign-editor/`)

- **Campaign Management**: Full CRUD operations for campaigns
- **Modern Stack**: Nuxt 4, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn-vue migration complete
- **Dual Mode**: Local file system + SPA mode with localStorage
- **Import/Export**: ZIP file operations
- **OpenTTD Theming**: Authentic game-inspired UI design
- **Store Implementation**: useCampaignStore composable fully implemented with all CRUD operations
- **Routing Architecture**: Correct RESTful routing pattern implemented
  - `/campaigns` - Collection view with hash-based new campaign creation (`#new`)
  - `/campaigns/[id]` - Individual campaign edit pages
  - Proper separation of collection vs item management
- **Schema Integration**: Using centralized schemas from `@schemas.ts` instead of duplicates
- **Type Safety**: Discriminated union types for Objective preventing invalid combinations
- **Atomic Design**: Component hierarchy architecture designed following atomic design principles

### Documentation (`docs/`)

- **ADRs**: 16 Architecture Decision Records including atomic design system
- **Migration Docs**: Detailed migration completion documentation
- **Component Architecture**: Comprehensive documentation of atomic design hierarchy

## ðŸš§ Todo

### GameScript Mod

- **Goal Progress Tracking**: UpdateProgress() methods not fully implemented
  - Event listeners for cargo delivery, station building, vehicle creation
  - Progress calculation and storage
  - Goal completion detection and rewards
- **UI Rendering**: Dashboard UI rendering methods incomplete
  - StoryBook page creation and updates
  - Goals window entries with progress bars
  - News messages for milestones and completion
- **Event Handling**: Game event listeners for goal progress
  - Cargo delivery event handling
  - Station construction event handling
  - Vehicle creation/removal event handling
- **Settings Integration**: Connect settings to actual functionality
  - UI visibility toggles working
  - Reminder system implementation
  - Reward system integration

### Campaign Editor

- **Atomic Design Implementation**: Implement the designed component hierarchy
  - Create Molecule/ components (Display, Form/Group, Form/Conditional, Form/Collection)
  - Create Domain/ components for specialized types (Objective, Constraints, RewardSet, MetaInfo)
  - Create Entity/ components with proper visual intents (Goal, Campaign, Scenario, Manifest)
  - Create Aggregate/ components for collections (Goals, Campaigns, Scenarios)
  - Create Template/ components for layouts (Layout/List, Layout/Grid, Screen/Article, Screen/Collection)
- **Page Migration**: Migrate existing pages to use new component architecture
  - Migrate goal pages to use Entity/Goal/ components
  - Migrate scenario pages to use Entity/Scenario/ components
  - Migrate campaign pages to use Entity/Campaign/ components
  - Replace monolithic page components with composed atomic components
- **Advanced Validation**: Business rule validation beyond schema
  - Cross-field validation (min/max players, date ranges)
  - Goal reference validation
  - Circular dependency detection
- **Preview System**: Real-time preview of campaign changes
  - Live preview of goal descriptions
  - Constraint validation feedback
  - Campaign flow visualization
- **Form Integration**: Complete form functionality for new campaign creation
  - Basic information fields (ID, title, difficulty, description)
  - Tags management (add/remove)
  - Scenarios management (add/remove/reorder)
  - Form validation and error handling

### Testing & Integration

- **End-to-End Testing**: Test full workflow from editor to game
  - Create campaign in editor
  - Export and import in OpenTTD
  - Goal progress tracking in game
  - UI updates in game
- **Goal Progress**: Test goal tracking in actual OpenTTD
  - Cargo delivery tracking
  - Station building tracking
  - Vehicle count tracking
- **Multiplayer Testing**: Test in multiplayer scenarios
  - Shared goal progress across companies
  - Personal goal isolation
  - UI updates for all players

## ðŸ’­ Future Considerations

### GameScript Mod

- **Dynamic Goal Loading**: Load goals from compiled YAML data
  - Runtime YAML parsing
  - Goal instantiation from data
  - Constraint evaluation
- **Advanced UI**: More sophisticated in-game UI elements
  - Progress bars and charts
  - Leaderboards for shared goals
  - Goal history and statistics
- **Performance**: Optimization for large multiplayer games
  - Efficient event handling
  - Memory management for large goal sets
  - Network optimization for multiplayer

### Campaign Editor

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user editing
  - WebSocket-based real-time updates
  - Conflict resolution
  - User presence indicators
- **Advanced Features**: Clone/copy, bulk editing
  - Campaign duplication
  - Goal copying between scenarios
  - Bulk operations (delete, modify, export)
- **Plugin System**: Extensible goal types and validation
  - Plugin architecture
  - Custom goal type definitions
  - Third-party validation rules
