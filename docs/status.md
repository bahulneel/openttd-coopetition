# Project Status

## âœ… Done

### GameScript Mod (`src/`)

- **Core Classes**: PlayerGoal, SharedGoal, Campaign, Dashboard classes implemented
- **Basic Structure**: Main controller with settings and state management
- **API Integration**: OpenTTD GS API v14+ registration and settings
- **UI Framework**: Dashboard class for UI management with StoryBook integration
- **Goal Types**: Cargo delivery, town population, station rating, network length, vehicle count
- **Progress Tracking**: Complete implementation of UpdateProgress() and SetProgress() methods
- **Event Handling**: Full event system for cargo delivery, station building, vehicle creation/removal
- **UI Rendering**: StoryBook-based UI with shared goals, personal goals, and onboarding pages
- **Settings Integration**: Working UI visibility toggles and reminder system
- **Data-Driven Goals**: Support for loading compiled YAML campaign data at runtime

### Campaign Content (`campaigns/`)

- **YAML Files**: Sample campaigns, goals, and scenarios in YAML format
- **Build System**: `compile-authoring.mjs` tool for YAML â†’ Squirrel compilation
- **Validation**: Schema validation in compilation tool

### Build Tools (`tools/`)

- **Compilation**: `compile-authoring.mjs` - YAML to Squirrel compiler
- **API Verification**: `verify-gs-api.mjs` - OpenTTD GS API usage validation
- **ESLint Plugin**: `eslint-plugin-openttd-gs` - Custom GameScript linting
- **Documentation Cache**: `gs-doc-cache.mjs` - API documentation caching

### Campaign Editor (`workspaces/campaign-editor/`)

- **Campaign Management**: Full CRUD operations for campaigns
- **Modern Stack**: Nuxt 4, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn-vue migration complete
- **Dual Mode**: Local file system + SPA mode with localStorage
- **Import/Export**: ZIP file operations
- **OpenTTD Theming**: Authentic game-inspired UI design
- **Store Implementation**: useCampaignStore composable fully implemented with all CRUD operations
- **Routing Architecture**: Correct RESTful routing pattern implemented
  - `/campaigns` - Collection view with hash-based new campaign creation (`#new`)
  - `/campaigns/[id]` - Individual campaign edit pages
  - Proper separation of collection vs item management
- **Schema Integration**: Using centralized schemas from `@schemas.ts` instead of duplicates
- **Type Safety**: Discriminated union types for Objective preventing invalid combinations
- **Atomic Design**: Component hierarchy architecture designed following atomic design principles
- **Component Implementation**: Partial implementation of atomic design components
  - Template components: Layout/Stacked, Layout/Section, Layout/Grid, Layout/Sequential, Screen/Dashboard
  - Molecule components: Header, Footer, Navigation/Bar, Dashboard/Card, Action/Button, Action/Link
  - Entity components: Goal/Display/Card, Campaign/Display/*, Scenario/Display/*
  - Domain components: Objective/*/Input/Details, Constraints/Input/Details, RewardSet/Display/Summary

### Documentation (`docs/`)

- **ADRs**: 16 Architecture Decision Records including atomic design system
- **Migration Docs**: Detailed migration completion documentation
- **Component Architecture**: Comprehensive documentation of atomic design hierarchy

## ðŸš§ Todo

### GameScript Mod

- **API Limitations Workarounds**: Some functionality simplified due to OpenTTD GS API limitations
  - Station ownership checking not available (station counting simplified)
  - Town service tracking simplified (cannot directly check which towns are served)
  - Route efficiency tracking placeholder (complex to implement without detailed route tracking)
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for large multiplayer games
  - Efficient event handling for many companies
  - Memory management for large goal sets
  - Network optimization for multiplayer synchronization

### Campaign Editor

- **Atomic Design Implementation**: Complete the designed component hierarchy
  - Create remaining Molecule/ components (Display, Form/Group, Form/Conditional, Form/Collection)
  - Create remaining Domain/ components for specialized types (Objective, Constraints, RewardSet, MetaInfo)
  - Create remaining Entity/ components with proper visual intents (Goal, Campaign, Scenario, Manifest)
  - Create Aggregate/ components for collections (Goals, Campaigns, Scenarios)
  - Create remaining Template/ components for layouts (Layout/List, Layout/Grid, Screen/Article, Screen/Collection)
- **Page Migration**: Migrate existing pages to use new component architecture
  - Migrate goal pages to use Entity/Goal/ components
  - Migrate scenario pages to use Entity/Scenario/ components
  - Migrate campaign pages to use Entity/Campaign/ components
  - Replace monolithic page components with composed atomic components
- **Advanced Validation**: Business rule validation beyond schema
  - Cross-field validation (min/max players, date ranges)
  - Goal reference validation
  - Circular dependency detection
- **Preview System**: Real-time preview of campaign changes
  - Live preview of goal descriptions
  - Constraint validation feedback
  - Campaign flow visualization
- **Form Integration**: Complete form functionality for new campaign creation
  - Basic information fields (ID, title, difficulty, description)
  - Tags management (add/remove)
  - Scenarios management (add/remove/reorder)
  - Form validation and error handling

### Testing & Integration

- **End-to-End Testing**: Test full workflow from editor to game
  - Create campaign in editor
  - Export and import in OpenTTD
  - Goal progress tracking in game
  - UI updates in game
- **Goal Progress**: Test goal tracking in actual OpenTTD
  - Cargo delivery tracking
  - Station building tracking
  - Vehicle count tracking
- **Multiplayer Testing**: Test in multiplayer scenarios
  - Shared goal progress across companies
  - Personal goal isolation
  - UI updates for all players

## ðŸ’­ Future Considerations
